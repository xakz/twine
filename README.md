Yet another string library for C.

Just wanted to play with compound literals in C99.

Code is commented and HTML documentation can be generated if you
install [Doxygen][]

[doxygen]: http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

Code can be unit tested using the [Check][] unit testing framework

[check]: https://libcheck.github.io/check/

The library works well but you will propably prefer more known-to-be-robust
library like Glib.

How known, sometime in the future, this library can become usefull...
